Design for relevant Coronaviridae species.

This designs for all species except SARS, specific against all other species.
The SARS species is designed as part of ../sars/.

Notes:
  * I left out two unclassified bat coronavirus taxa, which together have 13
    sequences. Many should clearly be put into classified species, so this
    would make specificity challenging. I manually moved two sequences into
    the SARS species (including RaTG13), which should clearly be within
    the SARS species.
