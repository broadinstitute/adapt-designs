Design for relevant Pneumoviridae species.

This only designs for:
  - Human orthopneumovirus (HRSV)
  - Human metapneumovirus (HMPV)
but designs are specific against all other species.

Notes:
  * I left out the taxon 'Pneumoviridae,,Respiratory syncytial virus' (RefSeq NC_001803),
    which is labeled as unclassified. It has just 25 sequences; 'Pneumoviridae,Orthopneumovirus,Human orthopneumovirus'
    (also HRSV) has many more.
